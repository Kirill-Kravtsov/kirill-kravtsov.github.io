* [DropHead Pytorch implementation](https://github.com/Kirill-Kravtsov/drophead-pytorch)
A Pytorch implementation of [Scheduled DropHead: A Regularization Method for Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13342.pdf). This implementation was designed to work on top of [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) package. Currently it works for Bert, Roberta and XLM-Roberta.
